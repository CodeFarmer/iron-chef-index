# iron-chef-index

A Clojure program to convert the HTML data from [the Wikipedia list of Iron Chef episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iron_Chef_episodes) into a sqlite database. The end goal is to combine that with the Internet Archive files for Iron Chef to provide a comprehensive index of episodes by challenger, season, Iron Chef and ingredient.

## Usage

To reset the database to its empty state:
> sqlite3 index.sqlite < index.sql

To run the unit tests (including recreating an empty testing database):
> ./run-tests.sh

To build the database (from a REPL):
> (iron-chef-index.core/execute!)
